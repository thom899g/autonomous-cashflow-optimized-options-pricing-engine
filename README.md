# Autonomous Cashflow-Optimized Options Pricing Engine

This repository contains the implementation of an AI-powered system designed to autonomously optimize call and put options pricing across multiple exchanges. The system aims to maximize risk-adjusted returns while maintaining full operational autonomy.

## Architecture Overview

The system is composed of several key modules:

1. **Market Data Collector**: Acquires real-time and historical market data from various exchanges.
2. **Data Preprocessing Pipeline**: Processes raw data into a usable format for the pricing engine.
3. **Options Pricing Model**: Uses machine learning algorithms to predict optimal options prices.
4. **Risk Management System**: Monitors and manages risk exposure in real-time.
5. **Execution Engine**: Executes trades based on model predictions.
